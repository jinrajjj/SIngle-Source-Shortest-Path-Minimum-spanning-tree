# Graph Algorithms
This is a Java implementation of two Graph Algorithms:
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm (for finding Shortest Path)
2. Kruskal's Algorithm (for finding Minimum Spanning Tree)

# How to run:
1. You need to run the Main.java class. It contains the main() method.
2. After running the project, you need to select the input file from the provided six files by entering the file number.
3. Note that file 1, 2 ,3 and 4 have Undirected Graphs and file  5 and 6 have Directed Graphs.
4. After you enter the file number, please choose the action to perform (whether to find Shortest Path or Minimum Spanning Tree).
